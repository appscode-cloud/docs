# Enable Feature Sets on General, Hub, and Spoke Clusters

A **Feature Set** is a group of product capabilities (for example Backup & Recovery or Databases) that you can enable on a cluster. Where you enable it depends on what kind of cluster you are working with, so first identify the cluster type, then follow the matching steps below.

## Cluster types

Every cluster you add to the platform is one of three types.

| | General cluster | Hub cluster | Spoke cluster |
|---|---|---|---|
| What it is | A standalone cluster managed on its own | The central cluster that manages other clusters | A cluster connected to a hub and managed from it |
| Connected to a hub? | No | It is the hub | Yes |
| Typical role | Runs workloads; managed individually | Control plane for the fleet; stores cluster state and distributes applications and policies | Runs workloads; receives configuration from the hub |
| How it is created | Import a cluster without selecting a hub | Enable the **Multicluster Hub** feature set. See [Hub UI](../hub-ui/introduction.md) | Import with a hub selected, or enable **Multicluster Spoke**. See [Create a Spoke Cluster](../hub-ui/spoke.md) |
| Feature sets are enabled | On that cluster, one cluster at a time | On the hub only | From the hub, per ClusterSet |
| Scope of one change | That cluster | The hub only | Every spoke in the ClusterSet |

* **ClusterSet**: a named group of spoke clusters. Spoke feature sets are enabled per ClusterSet, not per individual spoke. See [Cluster & Clusterset](../hub-ui/cluster-and-clusterset.md).

## Which cluster type should I use?

Choose the type by how many clusters you manage and whether they should share configuration.

| If your situation is... | Use | Why |
|---|---|---|
| One cluster, or a few unrelated clusters you manage separately | **General cluster** | No hub to run or maintain; each cluster is configured on its own |
| Many clusters that should get the same features and policies | **Hub + spokes** | Configure once on the hub and it applies to every spoke in a ClusterSet |
| Clusters that need different feature sets (for example production and development) | **Hub + spokes in separate ClusterSets** | Each ClusterSet has its own feature sets |

Trade-off: a hub is an extra cluster to run, and spokes depend on it for feature changes. For a single cluster, a general cluster is simpler.

## Where should I enable the feature on?

| | General cluster | Hub feature sets | Spoke feature sets |
|---|---|---|---|
| Applies to | That cluster only | The hub cluster only | Every spoke in the selected ClusterSet |
| Where to open it | Cluster → **Overview** → **Feature Sets** | Hub cluster → **Overview** → **Feature Sets** | Hub UI → hub **Overview** → **Cluster Sets** → *ClusterSet* → *feature set* |
| Example | Enable Databases on a standalone cluster | Enable Backup & Recovery on the hub | Enable Config Syncer on all spokes in `prod-set` |

## Enable a feature on the hub cluster

1. Open your hub cluster. The **Overview** page has a **Feature Sets** section.
2. Select the feature set you want, for example **Backup & Recovery**.
3. On that feature set's page, enable and configure the features you need.

![Feature Sets grid on the Overview page](../images/cluster-features/features.png)

The full enable flow is the same as for any cluster. See [Manage Feature Sets](../cluster-features.md) and [Cluster Overview](../cluster-overview.md).

## Enable a feature on spoke clusters

Spoke feature sets are managed from the hub, per ClusterSet.

1. Open the hub in the Hub UI. The **Overview** page has a **Cluster Sets** section with one card per ClusterSet, showing its name and **Number of Managed Cluster**. Click the ClusterSet that contains your spokes.

   ![Cluster Sets section on the hub Overview page](../images/cluster_and_clusterset/clustersets.png)

2. The ClusterSet's **Feature Sets** page lists every feature set with an **Installed** or **Not Installed** badge. Below the cards, **All cluster overview** and the **Cluster list** show the spokes in this ClusterSet. Click the feature set you want, for example **Secret Management** (**Not Installed**).

   ![Feature Sets page of a ClusterSet](../images/cluster_and_clusterset/cluster_set_feature_1.png)

3. The feature set page lists its **Components**, for example Config Syncer, External Secrets and Reloader. Click **Enable** at the top right.

   ![Secret Management feature set before enabling](../images/cluster_and_clusterset/enable_feature.png)

4. On the **Configure** page, tick the components you want to install. Enabling a component also enables any prerequisite components it needs. Click **Preview**, or **Cancel** to go back without changes.

   ![Select the components to install](../images/cluster_and_clusterset/select_feature.png)

5. **Preview** shows the `helm_release.yaml` that will be applied, in **YAML** or **JSON** with a **Copy** button. Review it, then click **Submit**. Click **Previous** to change your selection.

   ![Preview of the generated helm release](../images/cluster_and_clusterset/preview_feature.png)

6. After a successful submit, the feature set page shows **Configure** and **Disable** in place of **Enable**. Use **Configure** to change the selected components later. Each enabled component is marked with a green check, for example **Config Syncer**.

   ![Feature set after it is enabled](../images/cluster_and_clusterset/enabled_feature.png)

The **Out of sync & Unaligned clusters** table at the bottom of the page lists the spokes in the ClusterSet with two columns:

| Column | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Additional feature list** | Features enabled on the spoke but not on the hub (unaligned) |
| **Out of sync feature list** | Hub features that have not been applied to the spoke yet |

A `-` in both columns means the spoke matches the hub. **No Data Available** (as before you enable) means there is nothing to compare yet. The change applies to all spoke clusters in the ClusterSet. See [Cluster & Clusterset](../hub-ui/cluster-and-clusterset.md).

> **Note:** Do not manage feature sets directly on a spoke cluster. Make feature changes from the hub so the two stay in sync.

## Quick reference

| Task | How to do it |
|---|---|
| Enable a feature on a standalone (general) cluster | Cluster → Overview → Feature Sets → *feature set* |
| Enable a feature on the hub | Hub cluster → Overview → Feature Sets → *feature set* |
| Enable a feature on all spokes in a group | Hub UI → hub Overview → Cluster Sets → *ClusterSet* → *feature set* → Enable |
| Check whether spokes match the hub | ClusterSet → *feature set* → Out of sync & Unaligned clusters table |
